I think there are a couple great potential workflows for the application.  If clients do a little setup the flow can really be seamless.

Scenario  1:

I bill my clients with one rate assigned to a Project.

In Tick I start a new time tracking project.

In FreshBooks I make sure the client name and project name match the client name and project name from Tick.
In FreshBooks I assign a project rate to the project.

Now whenever I create an invoice from Tick data for that project it will automatically pull the project rate and apply to hours regardless of summarized or detailed invoice.

Scenario  2:

I have different rates for different tasks and want to create an invoice that incorporates the different task rates in one invoice.

In this case my billing is not project centric but item/task centric.
In FreshBooks I make sure the client name matches the client name from Tick.
In FreshBooks I create Items that reflect tasks with different billing rates and assign various rates to the items (Design, Programming, Database, Maintenance , etc).

In Tick I use the Item names to describe Tasks for my project.

In this case I would want to create a detailed invoice because tasks could have different rates.
Now whenever I create an invoice from Tick data for that project it will automatically pull the Item rates and apply to tick hours for each entry.

Scenario  3:

Just create an invoice I'll fill in the details later.

The minimum requirement is to have client names match in both Tick and FreshBooks.  If they try to create an invoice without a matching client name in FreshBooks it will prompt them to do so and allow them to submit the invoice again.  Without matching a project rate or a item rate the rate will default to 0.
