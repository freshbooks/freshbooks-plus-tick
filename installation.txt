$db['production']['password'] = "";
$db['production']['database'] = "";

1. Set base site url.

$config['base_url']	= "http://addons.freshbooks.com/tick/";

MAIL SETTINGS:

This application also uses mail so you may need to change some of the mail settings.  The default values worked in both my local and remote development servers.

In application/config/email.php:

any changes as necessary.

Also you may want to change mail settings that are used in application/controllers/user/reset_password_request():

$this->email->from('kyleh@mendtechnologies.com', 'FreshBooks + Tick');
$this->email->to($email);
$this->email->subject('FreshBooks + Tick Password Reset Request');
$this->email->message('Please click the following link to reset your FreshBooks + Tick password: '."\n". $url);
